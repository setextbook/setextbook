I won't tell you how to be a software engineer; You'll learn that over time by doing it. Instead, this book is about \textbf{software engineering methods}: Ways people achieve specific objectives in software engineering---that can save your project. My hope is that, after reading this book (or parts of it), you feel better equipped for software engineering.

\section{What's software engineering?}

Let's build a definition from the bottom up:\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Software engineering\index{software engineering} is not the same as programming
\item Software engineering involves trying to apply \textbf{methods}
\item Software engineering involves trying to make programs that have a long lifespan (\textbf{sustainable}\index{sustainability})
\item Software engineering involves trying to make programs that can be added to\marginpar{\methodDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\sustainabilityDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\extensibleDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\tripleConstraintDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\softwareEngineeringDef} (\textbf{extensible}\index{extensibility})
\item Software engineering involves trying to balance time, cost, and scope (the \textbf{triple constraint}\index{triple constraint})
\item Software engineering often involves teamwork\index{teamwork}
\item Software engineering involves trying to solve problems people care about
\item Software engineering involves both artistry and science.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Our definition:}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Software engineering} is the art and science of using different methods to efficiently create extensible, sustainable programs that solve problems people care about.
\end{quote}

\section{What's the philosophy behind this book?}

My set of beliefs about software engineering influenced how I wrote this book. Some of those beliefs (the ones that come most strongly to mind) are described below.

\subsection{Software engineering is not black and white}
Throughout the book, I've tried to communicate that \textbf{software engineering is the gray area of computer science}. ``Right'' answers can be difficult to find and may not be reproducible in different contexts. Software engineering as a field also keeps changing as research scientists gather new findings, engineers develop new technologies, visionaries define new methods, and the outside world changes (e.g., a pandemic happened while I was writing this book and that changed how software engineering teams collaborate). Whereas in programming you might ask, ``Is this algorithm correct?'', questions in software engineering are more like, ``How does my team know this software is ready to release?'' or, ``People keep misinterpreting my code, how do I shift it toward better understandability\index{understandability} and maintainability\index{maintainability}?''

\subsection{Studying every detail of software engineering is a waste of time}\marginpar{\agileDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\softwareProcessModelDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\iterationDef\margindivider}\marginpar{\incrementDef}
I'm \textbf{not going to tell you everything} you need to know about software engineering because (1) what you need to know can be drastically different depending on \textbf{context} and (2) if I tried to, this book would be thousands of pages long and possibly useless. Instead, I'll \textbf{introduce} a set of software engineering methods that are \textbf{known to be useful} across contexts, give guidance on when and why to use them, and point to \textbf{resources} for when you want more information.

\subsection{Agile isn't perfect but I really like it (and other people do too)}
This book leans so far toward \textbf{Agile} the two are probably in a relationship. That's because Agile development environments have become extremely \textbf{popular}---and because I like Agile: It matches how I think, and has been appropriate for nearly all the projects I've worked on. But you're not me, and Agile isn't the be-all-end-all, so I'm planning to incorporate more from other software process models in the future.

\section{What's this book like?}

It was written iteratively (``Do something. Now do it again, but better'') and incrementally (``Now do a little more''). Lots of software is written the same way. \\

\noindent It has \textbf{eight major topics}:\marginpar{Over here in the margin is where to find \textbf{definitions} (also in the Glossary).\margindivider}\marginpar{This is also where to find \textbf{asides}: Comments that are related to the content but don't fit into its flow or seem worth emphasizing.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Agile}\index{agile}: Collaboration-oriented philosophy of creating software that values \textit{doing} over \textit{comprehensive planning} and \textit{documentation}
    \item \textbf{Project management \& teamwork}\index{project management}\index{teamwork}: Working in an organized way---and with other people
    \item \textbf{Requirements}: Being clear about what's expected of the software
    \item \textbf{Unified modeling language (UML) class and sequence diagrams}\index{UML}: A couple types of diagrams useful for communicating how your code works (or should work)
    \item \textbf{Monolith vs. microservices architectures}\index{monolith architecture}\index{microservices architecture}: Two contrasting high-level ways to organize code
    \item \textbf{Paper prototyping}\index{paper prototype}: Creating a good user interface design\index{user interface}\index{user interface design} before coding it
    \item \textbf{Cognitive style heuristics}\index{cognitive style heuristics}: Making software work well for different kinds of people who are not like you
    \item \textbf{Code smells \& refactoring}\index{code smells}\index{refactoring}: Making your code nicer to work with
\end{enumerate}

\noindent It's \textbf{short} and written for readability:\marginpar{This book might get shorter before it gets longer; I've tried to keep chapters concise but informative.}\\

\begin{itemize}
\item Important terms and concepts are \textbf{bolded}
\item Margins contain \textbf{term definitions} and side notes (relevant additional thoughts)
\item \textbf{Additional resources} are listed at the end of each major chapter\\
\end{itemize}

My aim is that you be able to quickly (1) determine whether each topic or method is relevant to your situation and (2) get a basic understanding of the topic or method so you can discuss it with others or have a starting point for exploring more.

\section{What's the future of this book?}

\marginpar{For \textbf{source files, updated versions, or to make suggestions}: \url{https://github.com/setextbook}}I'll keep iterating and incrementing. If you have content requests, suggestions, or other feedback, you can create an issue or pull request on this book's GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/setextbook}. \\

\noindent \textbf{Potential future additions:}\\

\begin{itemize}
    \item Debugging
    \item Deployment
    \item DevOps
    \item Ethics
    \item More software architectures
    \item More software process models
    \item Object-oriented design principles
    \item Professionalism
    \item Software used by software engineers
    \item Testing your code (verification)
    \item More figures, examples, and images *\marginpar{* Yep, I'm the ``illustrator'' (a generous title).}
\end{itemize}
