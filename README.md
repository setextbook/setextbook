# The most recent edition of "Handbook of Software Engineering Methods" by Lara Letaw is available at [https://open.oregonstate.education/setextbook/](https://open.oregonstate.education/setextbook/)

Compared to the one here, the latest version more accessible, is in web format, and has been updated throughout.

I plan to continue using this repo for issue tracking.

# Old version

You can still download the old, PDF version at [https://github.com/setextbook/setextbook/raw/main/Handbook_of_Software_Engineering_Methods.pdf](https://github.com/setextbook/setextbook/raw/main/Handbook_of_Software_Engineering_Methods.pdf)
